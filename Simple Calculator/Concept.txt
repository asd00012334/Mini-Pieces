This is a Simple Calculator written in C#.
With specification that no more than one function directly triggered by click events
and also that no if-else & switch-case statement within,
(and of course no for any other forms of similar replacements)
I came up with an idea to store all of the function in an array of delegation
and access each delegation without any conditional statement.
(essencially using more memory to achieve that)
The idea came from my previous experience about optimizing CPU's assembly lines.
